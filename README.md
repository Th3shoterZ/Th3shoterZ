## Greetings!

I'm Wout, a belgian Fullstack Developer based in Germany.

I make my money with highly individualized IBE/WBE's (Internet/Web Booking Engine) for 4*+ Hotels in the DACH region. 

Here I mostly check out new stuff that I do not get to do at work. Like Homelab/Home automation, building tools to make my life a little easier (hopefully) and more.
But like a lot of other devs with a fulltime job, I suffer from almost never finishing projects...

Hobbies/Interests:
- Programming/building things (duh)
- Video games 🎮
- Motorsport html &#127937;
- Combining video games and motorsport (simracing)
- Metal music &#129304;
- Staying up till 4am to fix something that's broken in a personal project &#128563;
